Precedent refers to a legal principle or rule established in a previous case that is either binding or persuasive for judges deciding similar issues in future cases. While international courts do not adhere to precedent strictly speaking, they do cite previous judgments in an effort to build consistent case-law over time (Lupu and Voeten 2012). Precedential value can be seen as the influence or authority of a judgment for future case law building. 

In this project, I draw on powers of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) in order to process large quantities of legal documents (both judgment texts and EU laws) and thereby look into the factors behind precedential value. A variety of machine learning frameworks (Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, XGBoost) are applied to the problem. Findings are presented and discussed.
